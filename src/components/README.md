## Components Folder:

- Components make the task of building UI much easier.
- A UI is broken down into multiple individual pieces called components.
- Components are reusable and can be used in different parts of the application.
- Components are the building blocks of a React application.
- Components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”)
  and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

```
U can work on components independently and
then merge them all into a parent component which will be your final UI.
```
