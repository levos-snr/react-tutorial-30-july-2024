# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Why React project structure

- Project structure shows the organization of code and files, and a clean, simple,
  and decent project structure shows a clean written code, which helps to debug code,
  and another developer can easily read it.
- While deploying code on the server, it can recognize files easily, which is why
  developers are implementing clean, simple, and decent project structures.

## Best Practices for React Project Structure

- It is best practice to create a project structure
  for the React application, separate files according
  to their work, and separate them in the correct directories.
  For example, single components which can be used multiple places
  should be present in the components folder, and also standardize the
  naming conventions of the application so that it will be easy to verify
  the logic and presence of any particular file or folder.

- **Group by features or routes**:
  Grouping by features or routes is the most common
  way to structure a React project. This structure
  is easy to navigate and understand.

- **Group by file type**:
  Grouping by file type is another way to structure a
  React project.

- **Group by layer**:
  Grouping by layer is another way to structure a React project.
  This structure is easy to navigate and understand.

## Conclusion

- Creating a well-organized folder structure is important for maintaining
  a React project. It increases readability, maintainability, and
  scalability of the application. By adopting a well structure, it will
  be easy to manage code.
